\chapter{Rules of the Game}
\begin{description}
    \section{Objective of the Game}
    \item [Objective] In this game, each player ($i$) has the objective of disposing of all of their cards.
    \section{Setup of the Game}
    \item Let there be $n$ players, $3\leq n\leq 7, n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    \item Let there be a shared pot into which players may discard cards.
    \item Let there be a global type $\alpha$, defined as $\alpha_{0} = 1; \alpha_{t} = (\alpha_{t-1} \bmod 13) + 1$.
    \item The game uses a deck of 52 cards consisting of 4 suites. Each suite is $\{x | x \in \mathbb{N} \and x \in [1, 13] \}$.
    \item Initially, each player is given $\lfloor\frac{52}{n}\rfloor$, and $52 \bmod n$ cards are placed in the pot.
    \section{Defining a Player}
    \item Let the hand of $i$ be represented by a set $\{p_{i 1}, p_{i 2}, ..., p_{i 12}, p_{i 13}\}$ where $p_{i r}$ is the number of cards of type $r$, and $i$ is the player.
    \item Assume $\forall_{j}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} p_{ij} = 4$
    \section{Defining the pot}
    \item Let the pot be represented as player $\gamma$
    \section{Defining a Turn}
    \item Play is conducted counter-clockwise, and no player may be skipped.
    \item In a turn, consider the players $i$ and $j, i \neq j$.
    \item Let a turn ($t$) consist of the following sequence:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Player $i$ discards $k_t$ cards; $k_t \in [1,4], k_t \in \mathbb{N}$
        \item Player $j$ may "call BS"
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\forall_{i\in k_t} type(i) = \alpha_t \rightarrow$ j must take the pot
            \item $\exists_{i\in k_t} type(i) \neq \alpha_t \rightarrow$ i must take the pot
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    \section{The Problem}
    \paragraph{} Assume you are player 1 $p_{1 r}$. We must calculate $P(p_{i \alpha_t} \geq k_t)$
    \section{Levels of Thought}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The pot is empty and we have no knowledge of the player's cards.
        \item If a player $i$ tells the truth and player $j$ calls bluff in turn $t$, player $j$ definitely holds $k_t$ cards of type $\alpha_t$.
        \item The pot is treated as another player to whom cards are given in each turn
        \item The pot definitely holds the cards that you have placed into it in your previous turns, and when the pot is taken by a player $i$, $i$ definitely holds those cards.
    \end{enumerate}

\chapter{Describing the Initial State with $\forall_{i\in\gamma} i = 0$}
\section{Assumptions} 
\paragraph*{} To begin, let us find a formula to compute the relevant probability given the pot is empty and that there is no other information provided.
\paragraph*{Relevant Variables} The number of cards to distribute between $n-1$ players is $4-p_{0 \alpha_{t}}$. The number of cards player $i$ places is $k_t$, and the true amount they hold is $p_{i \alpha_t}$.
\begin{description}
    \item In general, to split $y$ items among $z$ people, There are ${y+z-1 \choose z-1}$ ways.
    \item We must count the number of ways in which $4-p_{0 \alpha_{t}}$ may be distributed between $n-1$ players. This is ${2-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} + n \choose n-2}$
    \item We must count the number of ways in which players $j$ such that $j\neq i$ can hold, which is ${1-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} - k_t + n \choose n-3}$ 
    \item We must count the number of ways in which player $i$ can hold $k_t$ cards, which is ${n-1 \choose k_t}$
    \linebreak
    \item This means that in the most naive case, the probability of player $i$ having exactly $k_t$ cards is  $\frac{{n-1 \choose k_t}\ast{1-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} - k_t + n \choose n-3}}{{2-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} + n \choose n-2}}$
    \item We must compute the probability from $k_t$ up to $4$, since a player may have more cards than what they play. $\sum\limits_{k_t}^{4} \frac{{n-1 \choose k_t}\ast{1-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} - k_t + n \choose n-3}}{{2-p_{0 \alpha_{t}} + n \choose n-2}}$ 
\end{description}
\chapter{Considering information about a player}
\paragraph*{} Throughout the game, we constantly gain information about each player. The first case in which you gain information is as follows. Consider a turn where player $i$ puts down $k_t$ cards of type $\alpha_t$, and player $j$ calls bluff. If player $j$ must take the pot, they definitely are holding $k_t$ cards of type $\alpha_t$. Their player count can be updated such that $p_{j \alpha_t}$ becomes $(p+k_t)_{j \alpha_t}$. Let this turn be denoted as $t*$
\paragraph{} We need to use this information to update our previous formula.
\begin{description}
    \item Instead of $p_{0 \alpha_{t}}$, we must use $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}p_{i \alpha_{t*}}$
    \item Remember, we must distribute the remaining cards in the same manner, because the player may have been holding some cards of type $\alpha_t$ before the turn.
    \item $\sum\limits_{k_t}^{4} \frac{{n-1 \choose k_t}\ast{1-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}p_{i \alpha_{t*}} - k_t + n \choose n-3}}{{2-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}p_{i \alpha_{t*}} + n \choose n-2}}$
    \item Of course, this ignores if the player making the move is also player $j$, since they definitely have those cards. To fix this, we must add back $k_{t*}$ back. 
   %\item $\sum\limits_{k_t}^{4} \frac{{n-1 \choose k_t}\ast{1-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}p_{i \alpha_{t}} - k_t + n \choose n-3}}{{2-\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}p_{i \alpha_{t}} + n \choose n-2}}$
\end{description}
